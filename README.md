# Breakpoint

### A student’s counterweight to a broken school system

Breakpoint isn’t another planner or “motivation” app. It’s built from the raw frustrations students deal with every day—overloaded workloads, burned-out teachers, no guidance, and the constant stress of trying to balance school with life.

Instead of trying to “fix” school, Breakpoint gives you leverage:

- **Offload the chaos** → dump assignments, tasks, and stress without overthinking  
- **Clear study plans** → practical, no-BS breakdowns so you know exactly what to do next  
- **Track what matters** → progress on your terms, not endless checkboxes  
- **Real strategies** → tools for focus, burnout, and navigating systems that don’t care

### Why it exists
School piles on busywork, ignores mental health, and often leaves students to figure it out alone. Breakpoint isn’t about pretending the system works—it’s about giving you clarity, agency, and tools that actually match the reality you’re in.

### What makes it different
- Not a “self-help” app  
- Not productivity theater  
- Not built for teachers or administrators—it’s built for students, by students

### Status
Currently in early development. Expect rapid changes, experiments, and rough edges.
